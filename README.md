AI Product Solution using Hugging Face API: Developing a Fraud Detection System

### Problem Description:
Financial institutions face the constant challenge of detecting fraudulent transactions among legitimate ones. Manual review of transactions is time-consuming and may not be effective in identifying complex fraud patterns. An AI-powered fraud detection system can analyze transaction data in real-time and flag suspicious activities for further investigation. Using the Hugging Face API, we can develop a fraud detection model that helps financial institutions identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

### Technical Solution:
We will create a Python script that utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to build a fraud detection model. The model will take transaction data as input and predict whether a transaction is likely to be fraudulent.
